### Binary Tree
- top most node in binary tree is called root
- bottom most nodes are called leaves
<hr/>

#### Binary Tree Node
1. each node contains
    * Data
    * Pointer to left child node
    * pointer to right child node


### Binary Tree Traversals
1. Tree Traversal is classified in two categories
    1. BFS
        1. level order traversal
    2. DFS
        1. Inorder traversal
        2. Preorder traversal
        3. Postorder traversal
