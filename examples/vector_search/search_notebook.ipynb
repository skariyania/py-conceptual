The lithium-ion battery, which gets nearly 40 miles per charge, has a lightweight form factor, making it easier for seniors to use. It comes fully assembled (no convoluted instructions!) and includes a sturdy helmet at no cost. The Plush saddle softens over time with use. The included Seatpost, however, is easily adjustable and adds to this bike’s fantastic rating for seniors, as do the hydraulic disc brakes from Tektro.  '},\n",

The 6061 alloy frame is triple-butted which ensures a lighter weight and smoother ride. And it’s comfortable with dropped seat stays and the carbon fork. The carefully crafted 50-34 tooth chainset and 11-32 tooth cassette give an easy-on-the-legs bottom gear for climbing, and the high-quality Vittoria Zaffiro tires balance grip, rolling friction and puncture protection when coasting down the other side.
